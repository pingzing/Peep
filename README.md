# Peep

A tiny, silly program to allow the user to press a hotkey (currently hardcoded to Ctrl + Shift + B) and
have a small bat pony show up and "Peep!" at you.

Runs a system tray application, and can be closed at any time just closing it from the systray, or just ending Peep.exe.

## Building

Requires .NET 6 and WPF.
Only runs on Windows. (Sorry.)
